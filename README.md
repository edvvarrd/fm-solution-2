# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page from the designs provided in the starter code.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My personal goals

This is my second challenge. I wanted to focus more on responsiveness on all available devices.

## Tools I used

To finish this challenge I used  HTML and SASS with BEM to make as clean code as I could. To get responsive design, I used Flexbox.

## Problems I had

There was no bigger problems with this challenge, except of being not sure of my own code - but I believe it will come with time.
